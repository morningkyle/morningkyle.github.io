[{"content":"Static Site Generation This blog is built with Hugo and deployed on GitHub using Static Site Generation (SSG). SSG is a modern web development approach that pre-builds website pages into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files during the build process. Unlike traditional dynamic websites that generate content on-demand for each user request, static sites deliver pre-compiled pages directly to users, resulting in faster load times and improved performance. Also, the stack is minimal, clean and easy to maintain.\n","permalink":"http://morningkyle.github.io/posts/blog-built-with-ssg/","summary":"My first blog post built with Hugo and PaperMod theme","title":"Blog built with SSG"}]
