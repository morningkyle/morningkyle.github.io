[{"content":"Building a Blog with Full Control I wanted to build a blog site where I have complete control over my dataâ€”not just how it\u0026rsquo;s presented, but also how it\u0026rsquo;s managed and versioned. GitHub Pages perfectly meets this requirement as a static site hosting service that\u0026rsquo;s built around a GitHub repository, giving me full ownership and control over my content.\nStatic Site Generation With GitHub handling data management and hosting, the next step is generating HTML-formatted content for web pages. This is where Hugo, an open-source Static Site Generation (SSG) tool, comes into play.\nSSG represents a modern web development approach that pre-builds website pages into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files during the build process. Unlike traditional dynamic websites that generate content on-demand for each user request, static sites deliver pre-compiled pages directly to users. This results in significantly faster load times and improved performance. Additionally, the technology stack remains minimal, clean, and easy to maintain.\n","permalink":"http://morningkyle.github.io/posts/blog-built-with-ssg/","summary":"Explains the choice made for this blog site: GitHub Pages and Hugo.","title":"Build a Blog Site with Full Control"}]
